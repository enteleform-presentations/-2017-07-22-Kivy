**Notes:**  
- Both examples produce an identical application, in terms of layout & functionality
- The first demo is written with `Python` only.
- The second demo is written with Kivy's `KV` language, as well as a minimal amount of required `Python` boilerplate.&nbsp;  `KV` is a simple, easy-to-read markup language which is based on`YAML`.
